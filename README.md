Cinephile means lover of films. Instead of collecting movie tickets, create a collection of movie reviews of your thoughts of every film you've watched.

Select movie reviews by their popularity, ratings or genre!

This is my Sinatra MVC project that focuses on nested forms, Capybara, ActiveRecord and Sinatra.

Installation:
This app requires 'activerecord', '4.2.5', Ruby version over 2.3.0, Rails 5.1.4, and Sinatra.

Once you have them installed,

fork & clone locally

cd into local directory

bundle install (requires shotgun to run localhost server)

rake db:migrate

run shotgun

open browser to http://localhost:9393
